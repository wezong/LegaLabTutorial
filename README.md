## About Lega Lab

The **Lega Lab** is a neuroscience research lab investigating the neural mechanisms underlying human memory. Led by **Dr. Bradley Lega**, our lab utilizes various methods, including:

- **Neurophysiology recordings**
- **Behavioral testing**
- **Computational modeling**

Through these approaches, we aim to gain insights into how memory functions in the brain.

## Research Focus

Our research primarily focuses on studying memory in clinical populations, including:

- **Patients with epilepsy**
- **Patients undergoing deep brain stimulation**

By working closely with patients and employing state-of-the-art techniques, we aim to:

- Advance our understanding of memory processes.
- Contribute to the development of effective treatments for memory disorders.
