## About Lega Lab

The **Lega Lab** is a neuroscience research lab investigating the neural mechanisms underlying human memory. Led by **Dr. Bradley Lega**, our lab utilizes various methods, including:

- **Neurophysiology recordings**
- **Behavioral testing**
- **Computational modeling**

Through these approaches, we aim to gain insights into how memory functions in the brain.
