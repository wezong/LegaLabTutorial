# Introduction

Welcome to the lab! This tutorial aims to provide you with an overview of the lab's activities and help you become a productive and contributing member. We will cover various topics, including:

- Setting up BioHPC
- Running analysis
- Patient testing
- And more!

## Lab Overview

Our lab primarily focuses on **programming**, with a strong emphasis on **Matlab**. While prior experience with Matlab is a plus, it is not mandatory. Many lab members have successfully learned programming from scratch, so don’t worry if you’re new to it. You are expected to learn quickly, and the best way to do that is by diving into coding.

To help you get started, several **template analysis and plotting scripts** are provided on BioHPC. These scripts will guide you through the basics of analysis. Keep in mind:

- Learning programming doesn't come from running code that works; it comes from fixing code that doesn’t.
- Debugging your own code is essential for improving your skills.

### Getting Started with Matlab

1. **Templates and Resources:**
   - Use the provided templates on BioHPC to get started with analysis and plotting.
   - Tackle initial challenges with patience; it's part of the learning process.

2. **Helpful Tools in Matlab:**
   - Use the `help` function to understand unfamiliar commands (e.g., `help reshape`).
   - Explore Matlab’s abundant online and offline documentation.

3. **Search Engines:**
   - If you're stuck, search for answers online:
     - Examples: 
       - "How to average values in MATLAB?"
       - "How to loop through files in a folder using MATLAB?"
       - "How to plot a line in MATLAB?"

4. **Debugging Strategy:**
   - Spend a reasonable amount of time troubleshooting errors before seeking assistance.
   - Remember, any lab member will be happy to help if you’re stuck.

5. **For Experienced Matlab Users:**
   - The templates serve as a guide.
   - As you become familiar with the analysis, write your own scripts to suit your needs.
